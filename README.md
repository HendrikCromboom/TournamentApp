# TournamentApp

### Overview

Initialy a usecase presented by my coach to test my structural skills, architectural knowledge and planning skills in pseudo code. Now I am going to build this usecase as a .NET app that runs in core with windows forms to power the UI.

### Tools

* Visual Studio
* .NET Core
* Windows Forms(netCore)
* Gimp
* Microsoft SQL Server

### Roadmap

* [X] ClassLibrary basic setup
* [X] UI Form basics
* [] Database Design
* [] Data connection/consumption (tbd: api or direct get)

### Credits

* Huge shoutout to my Coach Sicco Smith for providing me with yet another relatable real life project
* Many thanks to Tim Corey for providing a guide that is to some extent similar to this usecase, this allowed me to quickly get started with Windows Forms
* Could honestly never have even started on this without the comprehensive documentation that the Microsoft and .NET Core team provide
